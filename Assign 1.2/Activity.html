                        </div>   
                        <p class="section-container-spacer">The coronavirus outbreak has created a lot of problems. One major negative effect of the pandemic is that small businesses are suffering. As more people are staying in, these establishments are losing customers and money, which is a big deal for small stores. 
                            Another (admittedly less pressing) issue that has arisen as a result of COVID-19 is that many of us suddenly have a lot more free time on our hands, and we don't know what to do with it. It turns out, there are several ways to tackle both these problems at once.
                            If social distancing has you stuck inside going stir crazy, there are several activities you can do to pass the time and keep yourself grounded, and many of those activities can be done with the help of local businesses.

                        <div class="text-center">
                            <h3>1. Taking Virtual Class</h3>
                        </div>
                            <p class="section-container-spacer">While gathering in a classroom might not be advisable right now, thanks to the power of the internet, classes of all kinds are still available. 
                                Learning something new and thinking critically are great ways to stave off cabin fever.</p>

                            <h3>2. Do puzzles & play games</h3>
                        </div>
                        <p class="section-container-spacer">Another great way to put your brain to work is by doing a puzzle. Whether it's a traditional jigsaw or a book of Sudoku, puzzles are extremely stimulating, and they can be purchased at local game shops.
                            If you're looking to compete against someone other than yourself, get some board or card games from that small business. Ask the shopkeepers for their suggestions for the most invigorating and entertaining games that can include all your roommates.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="section-container-spacer">During the pandemic, try to learn something new such as bake or cook something delicious.
                            Instead of using ubereats or any other delivery application and keep order foods. By doing so, you can try and learn new skills
                            during the pandemic.
